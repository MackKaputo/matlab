Steps for running pushback simulation:

Step 1: Remove the blocks that are outside the ultimatepit (Run SLOPE_removal code)

Step 2: Generate Slope fil (Use mincutslope file). Please generate this only once.

Step 3: Generate block economic value (Use bevcal_price function inside this Work_UP&PS folder). This code needs to be edited according to your unit of price

Step 4: Pushback design using ultipit_production_sheduling function. This also needs to be edited according to the block size and specific gravity.

Step 5: Step 4 needs to be run multiple time by changing the production target.

Step 6: Use all solutions from Step 5 to get production schedule.
